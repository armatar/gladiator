# Gladiator

This is my long term learn-to-code project. The concept for it has changed quite a bit, but the idea right now is to create a combat system based around an old school rpg. May add story elements to it later. 

### Update 

This version of this project has been cancelled. I'm beginning it again in another repo which can be found here: 
[Gladiator V2](https://github.com/armatar/gladiator_v2)

# How To Run

The reaaaal apha story element can be run by running the gladiator.rb file in the app root. However, to test out the combat system, you can run /lib/testing_combat.rb. That's probably the better choice right now to see the updates.

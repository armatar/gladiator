GLADIATOR CONCEPT
	
	You come from obscurity -- a no one who dreams of fame and fortune. The life you've always wanted will be forged from this day forward on the sands of the arena floor. The countless enemies that you will face, the fickle eyes of the crowd, and the releness march of time all stand as a barrier to fulfilling your dream. Will you become a gladiator of legend, or will you end up nothing more than a momentary satiation of the people's endless bloodlust?

	Let's find out.
